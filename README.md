This is the repo for our workday calendar project

## Descriptions
This was the password generatoro assignment. I did not use a pop-op window for each element, instaed I opted for a single pop-up window to add all the sections of the password. I also created a slider instead of length input, and therefore did not need a warning for length because I sent the range from 8-128. I added a refresh button that generates a new password with the previously set parameters. If you click generate password then the form will be cleared and you will have to restart. If you try to generate a password without any of the elements, an error message will pop-up
